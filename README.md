# Research@DataRes - Coding Challenge

Instructions for starting off: 

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datares/research_challenge.git
```

Take a look at the tensorboard cell by running it. In substance, it just runs an instance of Tensorboard on the folder "logs". 

If you are not able to spawn tensorboard in a jupyter notebook, you can always run a local instance:

```bash
conda activate your_environment
pip install tensorboard
tensorboard --logdir logs
```

Then, after carefully reading the prompt, start your questions. 
Two of them can just be plain text. Not more than 500 words. 
The third question is a coding question. We'll judge you based on the resulting notebook that you send us / the information provided in your application. 

Good luck!
